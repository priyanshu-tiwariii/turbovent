# Turbovent-Grow Your Code, Not Your Headaches

## The Story Behind TurboVent  

Imagine this: You're all set to build an awesome full-stack project, but before you even write a single line of actual code, you're stuck **configuring Tailwind, setting up Express, integrating TypeScript, dealing with TurboRepo, and making sure ShadCN UI works seamlessly.**  

Sounds frustrating, right? 😩  

I’ve been there too! Every time I started a new project, I found myself repeating the same setup steps, fixing compatibility issues, and wasting **hours** before I could actually start coding. That’s when I thought:  

> *"Why does setting up a modern tech stack feel like a chore? There has to be a better way!"*  

And that's how **TurboVent** was born—a streamlined, fully-configured monorepo that eliminates setup headaches and lets you jump straight into building **without worrying about configurations.**

## The Problem  

Setting up a **Next.js + Express.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + TurboRepo + ShadCN UI** stack from scratch comes with challenges:  

⏳ **Time-Consuming:** You waste hours setting up the same dependencies over and over again.  
⚠️ **Error-Prone:** One wrong configuration and your whole project might break.  
❌ **Inefficient:** Every project requires manual setup, leading to **lost productivity.**
